                            NCEA is a course led by the finest minds in New Zealand, in an effort to assess and accordingly
                            grade the students across the entire country. However, despite the best efforts of teachers,
                            assessors and headmasters across the nation, there is a way to trick, to beat, to outsmart the
                            system in ways that your peers have never seen done before.
