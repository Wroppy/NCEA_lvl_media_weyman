                        NCEA is a course led by the finest minds in New Zealand, in an effort to assess and accordingly
                        grade the students across the entire country. However, despite the best efforts of teachers,
                        assessors and headmasters across the nation, there is a way to trick, to beat, to outsmart the
                        system in ways that your peers have never seen done before.
                        That is what this website is here to do for you today. Our goal is to ensure that our readers
                        are able to achieve the best possible grades by doing the least amount of work, so that you –
                        our reader – can pursue the academic goals you wish to achieve while also being able to, quite
                        frankly, hang out with all your friends. If you wish to scrape it through school, leave this
                        page. If you wish to excel, then stay.

                        Here you can challenge yourself on 3 different subjects, Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry,
